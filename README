This repository collects my project prepared for a Numerical Methods course (at GUT). 

First project - MACD Trading indicator
This project is an implementation of MACD (moving average convergence/divergence) trading indicator. 
It contains a sample usage, prepared on real gold shares from 2020 to 2023. 
A simulation of buying and selling shares has been included. The following libraries have been included: pandas, matplotlib, and datetime.

Second project - Systems of linear equations
This project implements various methods of solving systems of linear equations. 
The following methods were implemented: 
  -Jacobi's, 
  -Gauss-Seidel, 
  -LU_factorization. 
  Morover, this project was created withou using numpy library, meaning the operations on matrices were implemented.
  The following libraries have been included: pandas, math, and time.
